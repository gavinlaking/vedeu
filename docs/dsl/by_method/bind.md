### Vedeu.bind

Register an event by name with optional delay (throttling)
which when triggered will execute the code contained within
the passed block.

@param name [Symbol] The name of the event to be triggered
  later.
@param options [Hash<Symbol => void>] The options to
  register the event with.
@option options :delay [Integer|Float] Limits the execution
  of the triggered event to only execute when first
  triggered, with subsequent triggering being ignored until
  the delay has expired.
@option options :debounce [Integer|Float] Limits the
  execution of the triggered event to only execute once the
  debounce has expired. Subsequent triggers before debounce
  expiry are ignored.
@param block [Proc] The event to be executed when triggered.
  This block could be a method call, or the triggering of
  another event, or sequence of either/both.
